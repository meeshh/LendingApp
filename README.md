# Project Title
A Simulation for a Lending Application

## Project Description

This project conceptualizes a basic Lending Application where the user can request a short term loan for maximum of a one month period. The user has the ability to extend the loan (only once) for a period of 1 week after the initial deadline.

## Getting Started

First things first, make sure you have node and npm or yarn installed, clone the repo, go to its root directory in your terminal and run npm/yarn install. Once you have your modules installed, type npm/yarn start in your terminal. The app is configured to run on port 3000 of your localhost so a new tab will fire up in your browser.

This is created by the create-react-app
